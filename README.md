# Welcome to "Social Rank" Wiki!
 
Social Rank is a social network (under development) of user rating by users. I started with the intention of putting my
knowledge of PHP and JavaScript in practice, although the project does not have a defined architecture.

As you can see in the gif below, Social Rank has real time updates

### Why a people rating network?

What motivated me most was the fact that other social networks do not have an option to rate users (except those apps that users provide services are rated for the work done and not for their personality, friendliness or any other personal characteristics). Why not stop giving only like and deslikes when we can evaluate with grades?

## About the database (MySQL)
   
The database is currently divided into 8 tables.
1. Coments
2. Likes
3. Complaints (not yet used)
4. Images
5. Grades
6. Posts
7. Followers
8. Users

## About app features


The features at the moment are very simple. In "Social Rank" you can:
1. Follow / Unfollow users
2. Comment your opinion about someone on their profile
3. Evaluate from 1 to 5 other users
4. Post
5. Like posts and posts comments
6. Switch profile photo deliberately, even using GIFs
7. Write a description about yourself on your profile and change it whenever you want


### To use the network on localhost you need to have PHP and APACHE installed and a copy of the database tables (I'll make it available yet), so just move the / socialrank folder to the same directory as your own projects
